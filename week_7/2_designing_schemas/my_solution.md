## Release 5: Reflection
Very interresting. I did not know anything about designing schemas, or that they even existed. I have a broader perspective on how large some schemas can be later on. I understand the ideas somewhat, but the most trouble from this exercise was learning how to use the wwww SQL designer tool. It seems clunky and I feel there may be a better tool out there. Is this the preferred tool at dbc?
